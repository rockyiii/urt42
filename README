license: Urban Terror uses the Quake 3 SDK license

Urban Terror is a mod for Quake 3 Arena. Urban Terror can be freely distributed over the internet, unmodified, without charging for the product. Urban Terror uses the Quake 3 SDK license. This means the game code (the .qvm's in zpak000.pk3) are closed source and can only be distributed electronically over the internet, not on cd or dvd. The non-code data files of Urban Terror (zpak000-assets.pk3) can go on any medium however. The full license texts come with the installer, they outweigh the information provided here.

Urban Terror does not use any Quake 3 data, only its engine (on windows: quake3.exe) to run on. It therefor can also run on other executables created from the GPL'ed Quake 3 code. ioUrbanTerror.exe is such an executable and is distributed together with Urban Terror, but is a seperate product. Quake 3 can still be used to run Urban Terror on if the end-user prefers it. ioUrbanTerror uses the GPL license and its source code is openly available. ioUrbanTerror does not depend on Urban Terror, it can be used to run any Quake 3 mod or even baseq3, by setting the appropriate fs_game. When running Urban Terror on ioUrbanTerror, Urban Terror's close sourced .qvm's (quake virtual machine) are interprated by the open source engine (ioUrbanTerror).
